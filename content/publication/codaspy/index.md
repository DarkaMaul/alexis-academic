abstract: |
  While CVE have become a \emph{de facto} standard for publishing advisories
  on vulnerabilities, the state of current \gls{cve} databases is lackluster.
  Yet, \gls{cve} advisories are insufficient to bridge the gap with the
  vulnerability artifacts in the impacted program. Therefore, the community is
  lacking a public real-world vulnerabilities dataset providing such
  association.
  
  In this paper, we present a method restoring this missing link by analyzing
  the vulnerabilities from the \gls{aosp}, an aggregate of more than 1,800
  projects. It is the perfect target for building a representative dataset of
  vulnerabilities, as it covers the full spectrum that may be encountered in a
  modern system where a variety of low-level and higher-level components
  interact. More specifically, our main contribution is a dataset of more than
  1,900 vulnerabilities, associating generic metadata (e.g.~vulnerability type,
  impact level) with their respective patches at the commit granularity
  (e.g.~fix commit-id, affected files, source code language).
  
  Finally, we also augment this dataset by providing precompiled binaries for a
  subset of the vulnerabilities. These binaries open various data usage, both
  for binary only analysis and at the interface between source and binary. In
  addition of providing a common baseline benchmark, our dataset release
  supports the community for data-driven software security research.
