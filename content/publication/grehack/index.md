abstract: Disassembling is the backbone for multiple workflows in binary analysis and offloaded to specialized tools. However, programmatically manipulating the dissembler’s results is cumbersome. In this talk, we present Quokka, a binary exporter helping to reuse the disassembler results in an offline context. We then discuss some of its functionalities and provide some examples to demonstrate its potential.
