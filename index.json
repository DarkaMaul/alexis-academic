Indeed, because of the patch propagation delay or discontinued support, recurrent security patches are insufficient to prevent these vulnerabilities. The Firmware Matching Problem (FMP) asks to check if a patch has been applied to a complete system. In this paper, we detail a generic strategy to solve it and implement it in QSig, an automated binary patch detection solution based on semantic signatures. To face the challenges raised by this problem, QSig automatically generates a semantic signature by extracting the difference between the vulnerable and fixed version of the binary. Built to streamline the patches' detection on filesystems, QSig uses a robust matching algorithm to scan target binaries. We demonstrate QSig versatility and our approach pertinence by conducting several experiments in different contexts: a cross-architecture matching on smartphone images (Pixel 4) to emphasize our semantic signatures, a Debian live image to highlight its efficiency, and against an hybrid solution to compare both techniques.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Patch Detection using Binary Only Semantic Signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665493200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665493200,"objectID":"544cc9108f130a75205f3d8a3e416c49","permalink":"https://darkamaul.github.io/talk/towards-1-day-vulnerability-detection-using-semantic-patch-signatures/","publishdate":"2022-10-11T14:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/towards-1-day-vulnerability-detection-using-semantic-patch-signatures/","section":"event","summary":"This presentation was the Defense of my Ph.D. work","tags":[],"title":"Towards 1-day Vulnerability Detection using Semantic Patch Signatures","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1664388600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664388600,"objectID":"f553e83d2be7d5f09d5db9e7b11a1b0d","permalink":"https://darkamaul.github.io/project/quokka/","publishdate":"2022-09-28T19:10:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/quokka/","section":"project","summary":"Quokka is a Fast and Accurate Binary Exporter","tags":["Reverse-Engineering IDA-Plugin"],"title":"Quokka","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1651076070,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651076070,"objectID":"f024867be52c9d0c998d33eea75330f6","permalink":"https://darkamaul.github.io/project/aosp_dataset/","publishdate":"2022-04-27T17:14:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/aosp_dataset/","section":"project","summary":"Large vulnerability dataset based on CVE affecting AOSP and precise at a commit level","tags":["AOSP Security CVE Dataset"],"title":"AOSP Dataset","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alexis Challande","Robin David","Guénael Renault"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1648139367,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648139367,"objectID":"8a8a0670591f2f8593f098c164fb1e4b","permalink":"https://darkamaul.github.io/publication/codaspy/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T17:29:27+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/codaspy/","section":"publication","summary":"While CVE have become a \\emph{de facto} standard for publishing advisories\non vulnerabilities, the state of current \\gls{cve} databases is lackluster.\nYet, \\gls{cve} advisories are insufficient to bridge the gap with the\nvulnerability artifacts in the impacted program.
