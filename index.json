Therefore, the community is\nlacking a public real-world vulnerabilities dataset providing such\nassociation.\n\nIn this paper, we present a method restoring this missing link by analyzing\nthe vulnerabilities from the \\gls{aosp}, an aggregate of more than 1,800\nprojects. It is the perfect target for building a representative dataset of\nvulnerabilities, as it covers the full spectrum that may be encountered in a\nmodern system where a variety of low-level and higher-level components\ninteract. More specifically, our main contribution is a dataset of more than\n1,900 vulnerabilities, associating generic metadata (e.g.~vulnerability type,\nimpact level) with their respective patches at the commit granularity\n(e.g.~fix commit-id, affected files, source code language).\n\nFinally, we also augment this dataset by providing precompiled binaries for a\nsubset of the vulnerabilities. These binaries open various data usage, both\nfor binary only analysis and at the interface between source and binary. In\naddition of providing a common baseline benchmark, our dataset release\nsupports the community for data-driven software security research.\n","tags":[],"title":"Building a commit-level dataset of real-world vulnerabilities","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1648138470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648138470,"objectID":"6c25620f1023cb691bcb798caf2099df","permalink":"https://darkamaul.github.io/project/bgraph/","publishdate":"2022-03-24T17:14:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/bgraph/","section":"project","summary":"BGraph is a tool designed to generate dependencies graphs from Android.bp soong files.","tags":["AOSP Security Unified-Dependency-Graph"],"title":"Bgraph","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alexis Challande","Robin David","Gu√©nael Renault"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"55c19c103fd7a0d5968804beffaf6854","permalink":"https://darkamaul.github.io/publication/bgraph/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bgraph/","section":"publication","summary":"Contrairement aux GNU autotools, le syst√®me de build Soong, d√©velopp√© par Google, se pr√™te plus favorablement √† l'analyse de l'interd√©pendance des cibles de compilations.
